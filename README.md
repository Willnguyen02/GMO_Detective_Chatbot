# GMO_Detective_Interactive_Chatbot
Utilized IBM's Watson to create an interactive chatbot that identifies the content of produce based on barcode reference numbers. The chatbot creation process includes identifying user intents and sourcing relevant data pertaining to the produce. The chatbot would then be hosted in a sample Wix.com website for any users to interact with.
